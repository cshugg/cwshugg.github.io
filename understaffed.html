									<h2 class="major">Beneath the School lies a terrible beast...</h2>
									<p>
                                    Long ago, in times of magic, there existed the land known as Pelg.
                                    Creatures of yore roamed the earth. The mightiest and most terrible of
                                    these was the Vantursil. It was a massive serpent with three eyes, four
                                    monstrous arms, and venom that could kill a dragon.<br><br>
                                    
                                    For years, the Vantursil terrorized the people of Pelg, until a day came
                                    when they fought back. The greatest of wizards, hailing from the School
                                    of Orlomin, fought the terrible beast. Wielding the most powerful staves
                                    known to man, they sealed it beneath the school, never to see the light
                                    of day again.<br><br>

                                    70 years later, the chasm in which the Vantursil sleeps is about to be
                                    opened. A young boy studying at the School of Orlomin as an apprentice
                                    mage is in desperate need of a cure for his ailing brother. All other
                                    medicine has failed, but legend tells of the unmatched healing properties
                                    of Vantursil venom. The boy has sworn to descend into the earth, retrieve
                                    the four staves of power, and use them to slay the great beast that lies
                                    dormant in the cavern below.

									<h2 class="major">The Labyrinth of Orlomin</h2>
									<img src="images/understaffed/map.png" alt="A map of the four levels" />
									<p>The vast maze of rooms beneath the School are broken into four levels:</p>									
									<ul>
										<li>The Sunken Hall</li>
										<li>The Earthen Hollows</li>
										<li>The Surging Core</li>
										<li>The Blazing Depths</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
									Each level houses one of the four staves of power used to seal the Vantursil
									underground. Each staff has warped and affected their level in unique ways,
									thanks to their immense influence and power on the matter around them.<br>
									The <i>Staff of Oceans</i> was placed in the Sunken Halls, which caused water
									to seep in and and erode away what was once the School's Great Hall.<br>
									The <i>Staff of Mountains</i> was placed in the Earthen Hollows. The rock and
									soil became incredibly solid and unmovable, preventing any water from the
									Sunken Halls from dripping in from above. Amazingly, plantlife has grown on
									this level, despite being in the darkness of the underground.<br>
									The <i>Staff of Storms</i> was placed in the Surgining Core. Everything on this
									level has become charged with electricity. Creatures can summon lightning at
									will, and touching the wrong brick on the wall might electrocute an unsuspecting
									adventurer.
									The <i>Staff of Suns</i> was placed in the Blazing Depths. Fires roar all
									across this level and everything is singed. Standing in one place for too long
									could result in burns.

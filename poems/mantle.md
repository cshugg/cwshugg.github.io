# Mantle of the World

As children, we bewilder at the world before us.
As students, we learn not all is right.
As adults, we get angry and put walls between us.
As parents, we worry if their future is bright.

It descends quite slowly, the mantle of the world.
We can't see it coming, yet around us it will fall.
Don't let it smother you, it cannot be furled.
Instead wear it as a mighty cloak, and demonstrate to all.

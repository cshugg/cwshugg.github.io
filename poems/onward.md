# Onward I Go

Onward I go, yet behind me I gaze,
at the island now passed, whose shores I'll never again graze.
My ship cannot turn; its path is set.
I am doomed to ride until journey's end is met.

What lies ahead? Is it better or is it worse?
Is my unstoppable ship a blessing or a curse?
It's a blessing, I say, and though I cannot steer,
I am afloat, I am alive, and I am glad to be here.

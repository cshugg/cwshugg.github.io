# Lament for Memory

Why must memory fade?  
Memory is a gift to recall our past,  
a tool to see through the shade  
of Time's marching wall we cannot pass.

Yet gifts grow old,  
and we finally forget.  
Those valuable memories will escape  
our ever-changing wit.  

As they slowly depart from our mind,  
they are covered in layers of glaze and grime.  
The glaze is sweet, tasting of nostalgic past.  
The grime is sour, of dark deeds gone at last.  

Whatever the memory, out the door it goes.  
Does anyone recall its existence? Who knows.  
So, write it down, when you have a good thought.  
Preserve it time; forestall the inevitable rot.

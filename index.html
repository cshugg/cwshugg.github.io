										<p>
                                        I'm currently attending Virginia Tech, studying Computer Science.
                                        I plan to graduate with a B.S. in the spring of 2021. I'm also pursuing
                                        a Cybersecurity minor.<br><br>

                                        Virginia Tech is a wonderful place. I've made some great friends,
                                        had some amazing experiences, and am having a <em>lot</em> of fun.
                                        If you're reading this, and you're considering coming to VT, <em>do it
                                        </em>.<br><br>

                                        As a Computer Science major, I've succeeded in courses regarding
                                        Software Design, Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Organization,
                                        and Computer Systems. This stuff is <em>really</em> cool - I encourage
                                        anyone looking into CS to try it out in their free time.<br><br>

                                        I'm also a trumpet player in the Marching Virginians. It's a great
                                        group of people in which I've made many friends and have tons of
                                        unforgettable experiences. (I also get into football games for free,
                                        which is always a plus!). Again, if you're reading this and are on
                                        the fence about joining the marching band in college, I <em>highly</em>
                                        encourage you go for it.
                                        </p>

                                        I've been lucky enough to work as a Software Engineering Intern at
                                        Cisco Systems in RTP, North Carolina, for 4 years. (Summers of 2016-
                                        2019). To put it briefly, I helped develop automation tools and PCB
                                        simulation software for my team. Feel free to check out my LinkedIn
                                        profile for more information on what I had the opportunity to work
                                        on at Cisco!<br><br>

                                        This coming summer (2020), I've accepted an internship at Microsoft
                                        as a Software Engineer. I'll be working at Microsoft's office in
                                        the Raleigh area, NC. While I can't yet elaborate on the kind of work
                                        I'll have the chance to contribute to, I'm <em>really</em> excited.
                                        </p>

                                        In my spare time, I like to develop video games, work with Raspberry
                                        Pis, and explore what I can do/make with software.<br><br>

                                        In high school, I was able to develop a few video games that won the
                                        same national competition twice. This involved writing the code,
                                        creating the story, composing the music, and drawing the sprites. It
                                        was probably one of the cooler things I've created, and a really neat
                                        experience. I've listed a few links to tools I used to create these,
                                        as well as the links to the competition I entered.

									<h2 class="major">Why Programming is fun</h2>
									<p>
									One of my favorite professors at Virginia Tech uses a quote that I feel
									perfectly describes why I like Computer Science so much. Here it is:<br><br>

									"First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie,
									 so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design.<br>
									 Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep
									 within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful.<br>
									 Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of
									 interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out
									 the consequences of principles built in from the beginning.<br>
									 Fourth is the joy of always learning. In one way or another, the problem is ever
									 new, and its solver learns something."<br><br>
									(Freed Brooks)

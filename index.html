            <p>
            I'm a computer scientist with a passion for invention and security.
            I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and a minor in cyber security.
            I completed a victory lap with a M.S., also in computer science, in the spring of 2022, focusing on
            computer systems and security, with an emphasis on fuzzing.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-header3 color-text2">Research</h3>
            <p>
            During my M.S. degree at Virginia Tech (2020-2022), I created Gurthang,
            a fuzzing framework designed specifically for testing web servers.
            I introduced a novel design and showed its effectiveness through
            my evaluation.
            <a href="gurthang.html" class="text-link">Read more about it here!</a>

            <h3 class="text-header3 color-text2">Career</h3>
            <p>
            In the past, I've had multiple internships with both Cisco and Microsoft.
            I'm super grateful for those opportunities and learned quite a lot at both
            companies. Starting in August of 2022, I'll be working as a software engineer
            at Microsoft.<br>
            
            I also worked as a Teaching Assistant with the Virginia Tech Computer Science
            department for five semesters. The majority of my time was spent as both an
            undergraduate TA and a graduate TA for CS 3214 - Computer Systems.

            Dreaming up an idea, then sitting down and creating it, is something I really love.
            Mix that with a couple of computer science degrees and you wind up with lots of coding projects.
            Here are a few notable mentions of things I've created (or are still creating):

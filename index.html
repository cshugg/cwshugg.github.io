        <h1>Hello there</h1>
        <p>My name is Connor.</p>

        <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
        <h3>I'm learning HTML and CSS.</h3>

            Yep, that's right. This ugly barebone HTML site you're seeing is my first attempt at HTML.<br>
            I'm currently learning it (and CSS) for one of my courses this semester.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            I'm studying Computer Science at Virginia Tech, in the class of 2021.
            So far, I've taken courses focusing on:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Software Design</li>
                <li>Data Structures</li>
                <li>Algorithm Design and Analysis</li>
                <li>Computer Organization</li>
                <li>Computer Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(I definitely didn't make that list <em>just</em> to test out unordered lists in HTML)</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Section 2: More information? -->
        <div>
            <p>
            For now, this is all this site will display. That'll change eventually, but until then, if
            you want to get in touch with me or see my projects/experience, here are some links:

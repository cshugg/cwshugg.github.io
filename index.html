		<p>
		Yep, that's right. This ugly barebone HTML site you're seeing is my first attempt at HTML.<br>
		I'm currently learning it (and CSS) for one of my courses this semester.<br><br>
		</p>

		<p>
		I'm studying Computer Science at Virginia Tech, in the class of 2021.
		So far, I've taken courses focusing on:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Software Design</li>
			<li>Data Structures</li>
			<li>Algorithm Design and Analysis</li>
			<li>Computer Organization</li>
			<li>Computer Systems</li>
		</ul>
		<p>(I definitely didn't make that list <em>just</em> to test out ordered lists in HTML)</p>

            I'm a computer scientist with a passion for invention and security.
            I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and a minor in cyber security.
            My victory lap will be complete in the spring off 2022 with a M.S., also in computer science, focusing on
            computer systems and security, with an emphasis on fuzzing.

            <h3 class="text-header3 color-text2">Research</h3>
            <p>
            My M.S. thesis work has involved utilizing AFL/AFL++, an intelligent
            guided fuzzer, along with a series of libraries I have been creating,
            to perform effective fuzz-testing on web servers written in C.
            I've also put an education spin on things by integrating the fuzzer
            as an optional testing tool in Virginia Tech's
            <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/Undergraduate/courses/CS3214.html" class="text-link">CS 3214</a>

            <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gback/" class="text-link">Dr. Godmar Back</a>
            of the VT Computer Science department.

            <h3 class="text-header3 color-text2">Career</h3>
            <p>
            In the past, I've had multiple internships with both Cisco and Microsoft.
            I'm super grateful for those opportunities and learned quite a lot at both
            companies. Starting in August of 2022, I'll be working as a software engineer
            at Microsoft.

            Dreaming up an idea, then sitting down and creating it, is something I really love.
            Mix that with a couple of computer science degrees and you wind up with lots of coding projects.
            Here are a few notable mentions of things I've created (or are still creating):

                    An intelligent, customizable, source code guided fuzzer (WIP).
                    Inspired heavily by the wondrous

                    (and

            I've also worked on some pretty neat projects in school. Here are some of my favorites:

            <p>
            After I graduate with my M.S., I will have completed my fifth and final year in
            Virginia Tech's student marching band, the
            <a href="https://www.spiritoftech.com/" class="text-link">Marching Virginians</a>.
            I play the trumpet. Seriously, joining this band was one of the best decisions I
            have ever made. If you happen to be reading this as a Tech student and are on the
            fence about auditioning, let me help you: <em>do it</em>.

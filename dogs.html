									<p>
                                    I volunteer at the Christiansburg Animal Care and Adoption Center. There
                                    are lots of dogs living there that haven't been fortunate enough to be
                                    adopted just yet. As a volunteer, I get to come to the ACAC and walk these
                                    dogs around the shelter and the nearby park.<br><br>

                                    In an effort to give the ACAC (and the dogs I've walked) some publicity,
                                    I've created this page to talk about all the friends I've made there.

                                    Here are the dogs I've walked. I usually try to get a few pictures of them,
                                    so you can put a face to a name.

                                    Dexter is a black lab. He was the first dog I walked at the ACAC, and he's
                                    really sweet. He's pretty large too, as most labs are. His size and
                                    demeanor might be intimidating, but don't be fooled - I've walked him
                                    multiple times and he's never been aggressive or defensive.<br><br>

                                    When I took Dexter out for a walk, he was a bit of a leash-puller, but he
                                    listened to me (maybe not my words.. but he at least responded to my tugs)
                                    and was very obedient. He also really enjoyed breaking into a sprint every
                                    now and then! Like most dogs, he took in just about any smell he could
                                    sense, and would occasionally dart back and forth, trying to decide on
                                    what to explore next.<br><br>

                                    Overall, he was a great dog to have the chance to meet and walk. It seems
                                    like he'd make a great family member.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    Old Joe is a hound. Even though his name suggests it, he doesn't seem as
                                    old as you might think. When I unlocked his cage to put his collar and
                                    leash on, he was barking like crazy and jumped all over me in excitement.
                                    After quite a few minutes of attempting to get him leashed up (this
                                    included him launching the collar off his nose straight into his water
                                    bowl), I finally got down to business to taking him outside.<br><br>

                                    Outside his kennel, Joe's excitement never died down. In fact, it seemed
                                    to get stronger. He would beeline to anything interesting he saw or
                                    smelled, pulling me along for the ride. This made the walk a little more
                                    difficult than others, but Joe would still isten to my tugs on the leash.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Getting some decent pictures of Old Joe was challenging, considering his
                                    short span of attention, but I managed to get a few. Overall, he was very
                                    pleasant to walk and spend some time with. Like most dogs there, poor Joe
                                    didn't really want to get back in his cage. He actually ran away from me
                                    through a doggy door before I could get his collar and harness off, which
                                    was pretty funny.<br><br>

                                    I hope Old Joe gets a loving family. Despite his sporadic attention span,
                                    he was very sweet and would make a great friend.
                                    </p>

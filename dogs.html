									<p>
                                    I volunteer at the Christiansburg Animal Care and Adoption Center. There
                                    are lots of dogs living there that haven't been fortunate enough to be
                                    adopted just yet. As a volunteer, I get to come to the ACAC and walk these
                                    dogs around the shelter and the nearby park.<br><br>

                                    In an effort to give the ACAC (and the dogs I've walked) some publicity,
                                    I've created this page to talk about all the friends I've made there.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    You can find information about them

                                    Here are the dogs I've walked. I usually try to get a few pictures of them,
                                    so you can put a face to a name.

                                    <p>
                                    Dexter is a black lab. He was the first dog I walked at the ACAC, and he's
                                    really sweet. He's pretty large too, as most labs are. His size and
                                    demeanor might be intimidating, but don't be fooled - I've walked him
                                    multiple times and he's never been aggressive or defensive.<br><br>

                                    When I took Dexter out for a walk, he was a bit of a leash-puller, but he
                                    listened to me (maybe not my words.. but he at least responded to my tugs)
                                    and was very obedient. He also really enjoyed breaking into a sprint every
                                    now and then! Like most dogs, he took in just about any smell he could
                                    sense, and would occasionally dart back and forth, trying to decide on
                                    what to explore next.<br><br>

                                    Overall, he was a great dog to have the chance to meet and walk. It seems
                                    like he'd make a great family member.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    Old Joe is a hound. Even though his name suggests it, he doesn't seem as
                                    old as you might think. When I unlocked his cage to put his collar and
                                    leash on, he was barking like crazy and jumped all over me in excitement.
                                    After quite a few minutes of attempting to get him leashed up (this
                                    included him launching the collar off his nose straight into his water
                                    bowl), I finally got down to business to taking him outside.<br><br>

                                    Outside his kennel, Joe's excitement never died down. In fact, it seemed
                                    to get stronger. He would beeline to anything interesting he saw or
                                    smelled, pulling me along for the ride. This made the walk a little more
                                    difficult than others, but Joe would still isten to my tugs on the leash.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Getting some decent pictures of Old Joe was challenging, considering his
                                    short span of attention, but I managed to get a few. Overall, he was very
                                    pleasant to walk and spend some time with. Like most dogs there, poor Joe
                                    didn't really want to get back in his cage. He actually ran away from me
                                    through a doggy door before I could get his collar and harness off, which
                                    was pretty funny.<br><br>

                                    I hope Old Joe gets a loving family. Despite his sporadic attention span,
                                    he was very sweet and would make a great friend.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    Nelly is the third dog I had a chance to walk at the ACAC. I'm not sure
                                    exactly what breed he is, although it definitely looks like he's got some
                                    Pit Bull in him. What made Nelly stand out to me was how quiet he was when
                                    I saw him. All the dogs around him were yapping and barking (as they do
                                    whenever somebody comes by) in excitement, but not Nelly! Instead, he was
                                    lying on his bed, wagging his tail eagerly, and staring up at me.<br><br>

                                    When we left the building, Nelly was very calm, but still seemed to enjoy
                                    the fresh air. He wasn't too keen on running around - rather, he liked to
                                    take his time. He would occasionally roll over onto the ground and lie
                                    down for a few minutes. He enjoyed some pets and behind-the-ear scratches
                                    while he took those breaks.<br><br>

                                    Overall, Nelly was a very kind dog, with a sweet face and reserved
                                    personality. There's no doubt a home out there for him with a very lucky
                                    family!
                                    </p>

                                    <!-- Gilligan -->
                                    <h3 class="major">Gilligan</h3>

                                    <p>
                                    Gilligan is a hound/german shepherd mix, and an older gentleman. I got the
                                    chance to walk him after Thanksgiving break, on a misty day. He seemed very
                                    shy when I approached his cage to say hello. When I came back with a leash
                                    and a collar, he came out of his shell a little, as he started wagging his
                                    tail and wiggling around with excitement.<br><br>

                                    Walking him was a breeze. He was content to strolling along at a leisurely
                                    pace, sniffing things here and there. I was able to get him to run briefly,
                                    but he seemed to tire out a little quicker than other dogs. Gilligan was
                                    pretty receptive to the occasional stop-and-pets I gave him, and gave me a
                                    few wet kisses on the face for it.<br><br>

                                    Gilligan was very pleasant to walk. While he might not be the youngest,
                                    fastest, or most energetic, he's still a great dog (I imagine he'd be a
                                    killer lap dog, despite his large size). Here's to hoping Gilligan gets a
                                    family soon!
                                    </p>

                                    <!-- Bosco -->
                                    <h3 class="major">Bosco</h3>
                                    <img src="./images/dogs/bosco/bosco1.jpg" alt="An image of Bosco" width="576" height="324">

                                    <img src="./images/dogs/bosco/bosco3.jpg" alt="An image of Bosco" width="576" height="324">

                                    <p>
                                    Puppies are notoriously energetic, and while I've only met a few puppies
                                    here and there, Bosco was by far the most energetic and wild dog I've ever
                                    met. I'm not super sure what breed/mix he was, but he's expected to grow up
                                    to be a pretty big guy. As soon as I entered his cage, he began jumping up
                                    and down like crazy - this guy was excited!<br><br>

                                    Getting Bosco ready to go was an adventure in of itself. His collar went on
                                    just fine, but his harness... well, that took me about 10 minutes of
                                    struggling. After a long time of him chewing on everything he could find,
                                    including that harness, I had to ask for some help from one of the staff
                                    members.<br><br>

                                    Once I got outside, the excitement and energy continued. He darted back and
                                    forth, sniffing everything he could find, chewing on lumps of grass, and
                                    occasionally looking back at me with that "I wonder if he just saw me do
                                    that" look on his face. His leash was of particular interest to him.
                                    Rather than a leash, he took it as a rope to chew on! He would fling his
                                    neck backwards, chew on it, and inevitably get tangled up. It was a pretty
                                    entertaining walk.<br><br>

                                    I can say without a doubt that Bosco is one wild dog! He'll definitely calm
                                    down as he grows out of the pupy stage, but I don't think he'll ever lose
                                    all of that energy. His future family will need to be prepared to give him
                                    lots of time to burn that energy! Underneath that excitement, though, I can
                                    tell there's a soft, cuddly, lap-dog side to Bosco.
                                    </p>

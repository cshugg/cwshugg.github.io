            <p>
            I volunteer at the Christiansburg Animal Care and Adoption Center. There are lots of dogs living
            there that haven't been fortunate enough to be adopted just yet. As a volunteer, I get to come
            to the ACAC and walk these dogs around the shelter and the nearby park.<br><br>

            In an effort to gives the ACAC (and the dogs I've walked) some publicity, I've created this page
            to talk about all the different dogs I've walked.

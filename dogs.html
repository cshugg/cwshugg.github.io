            <p>
            I volunteer at the Christiansburg Animal Care and Adoption Center. There are lots of dogs living
            there that haven't been fortunate enough to be adopted just yet. As a volunteer, I get to come
            to the ACAC and walk these dogs around the shelter and the nearby park.

            In an effort to gives the ACAC (and the dogs I've walked) some publicity, I've created this page
            to talk about all the different dogs I've walked.

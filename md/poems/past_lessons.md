# Lessons of the Past

What can be learned from the past?
It’s long line trails behind me.
What lessons are there that must last?
Those past hardships do not bind me.

We don’t stand on the shoulders of giants.
We stand on hunched over backs.
Their bruises and scars stand defiant,
Against grief and sorrow and wrack.

Our mothers and fathers before us,
Learned many hard truths in life.
We easily forget these in surplus,
But they must be recalled to stop strife.

As I stand on hunched backs and live,
I’m grateful for the struggles of yore.
I’ll gladly hunch over, take pain, and give,
The next generation something good to live for.

            In 2021 I took a Financial Literacy course with Professor Thomas Reilly.
            I created these calculators to help me prepare for the future.

            <p>
            An <b>income statement</b> examines your income and expenses over
            some period of time (ex: monthly). Budgeting and tracking your
            expenses ties into this. A <b>budget</b> is an <em>ideal</em> income
            statement that's compared against your actual income statement.
            </p>
            <p>
            Collect a sum of all after-tax income and all expenses you've paid and
            plug them in here. It simply subtracts the two to tell you how much free
            income you can use for saving or investing. (I would recommend setting up
            a spreadsheet or other way to compute these sums more easily.)

            <p>
            A <b>balance sheet</b> examines your assets, liabilities, and net
            worth at a specific point in time. (Usually it's created and
            reviewed once a year.) It's like a snapshot of your financial
            situation. Your balance sheet is made from two main categories:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Assets</b>: things you own.</li>
                <li><b>Liabilities</b>: things you owe money for.</li>
            </ul>
            Your net worth is the difference between the two. Use this

            There are five financial ratios used to assess your financial health.

            <!-- ratio 1 -->
            <h3 class="text-header3 color-text2">Do I have enough liquidity for an emergency?</h3>
            <p>
                Your <b>current ratio</b> describes how well-prepared you are for
                an emergency (in terms of readily-accessible money). Aim to make this
                <em>at least</em> 1.0, but you should really go for 2.0 or higher.
                <em>Too</em> high isn't great, though, as this suggests most of your money
                is in assets, rather than investments or retirement accounts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your <b>month's living expenses covered ratio</b> describes how many
                months you could cover of your current living expenses <em>right now</em>
                if you stopped gaining income (if you lost your job, for example).
                Aim for around 3-6 months.

            <h3 class="text-header3 color-text2">Can I meet my debt obligations?</h3>
            <p>
                Your <b>debt ratio</b> measures your debts against your assets.
                For younger people (especially students with high student loans),
                this may start out high. However, you should aim to decrease this
                as you get older.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your <b>debt ratio</b> is:

            <h3 class="text-header3 color-text2">How does my long-term debt compare to my income?</h3>
            <p>
                Your <b>long-term debt coverage ratio</b> compares your gross income
                against your long-term debt payments. This ratio is supposedly important
                for taking out mortgages or large loans, as loaners will look at this
                ratio to determine if you qualify and/or what your interest rate will be.
                They'll want it to be under 40%. Aim for less than that so you have more
                flexibility.

            <p>
                Your <b>savings ratio</b> compares your left-over income from your income
                statement against your gross income. It tells you how much of your income
                you're able to save. Aim for around 10%, if not more.
